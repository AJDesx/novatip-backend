/**
 * notifications/webhook-failure.service.ts
 *
 * Tells a creator a registered webhook is failing, as a WEBHOOK_FAILED
 * Notification row.
 *
 * Before this, a dead receiver only showed up in the WebhookDelivery history
 * a creator had to think to go check — a webhook could be down for a week and
 * the creator would never hear about it. The enum value and the table already
 * existed for this; nothing wrote to them.
 *
 * One tip can reach several enabled webhooks, and an indexer that redelivers
 * (or a receiver that is down for days) can mean many failed tips against the
 * same broken endpoint. Without suppression that is one row per tip, which
 * drowns the one thing worth telling the creator — "this endpoint is down" —
 * in duplicates of itself. So at most one row is written per webhook per
 * SUPPRESS_WINDOW_MS, counted from the last one actually written rather than
 * from the first failure, which is what keeps a receiver that is down for a
 * week to a handful of rows instead of one per tip.
